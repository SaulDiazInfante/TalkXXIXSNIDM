nonlinear optimization that combines complementary approaches to nonlinear
optimization to achieve robust performance over a wide range of application
requirements. The package is designed for solving large-scale, smooth nonlinear
programming problems, and it is also effective for the following special cases:
unconstrained optimization, nonlinear systems of equations, least squares, and
linear and quadratic programming. Various algorithmic options are available,
including two interior methods and an active-set method. The package provides
crossover techniques between algorithmic options as well as automatic selection
of options and settings.},

vector-transmitted disease using two deterministic models. First, we look at
time dependent prevention and treatment efforts, where optimal control theory is
applied. Using analytical and numerical techniques, it is shown that there are
cost effective control efforts for treatment of hosts and prevention of
host-vector contacts. Then, we considered the autonomous counter part of the
mode and we established global stability results based on the reproductive
number. The model is applied to study the effects of prevention and treatment
controls on a malaria disease while keeping the implementation cost at a
minimum. Numerical results indicate the effects of the two controls (prevention
and treatment) in lowering exposed and infected members of each of the
populations. The study also highlights the effects of some model parameters on
the results.},

  Abstract                 = {We applied optimal control theory to an SI
epidemic model to identify optimal culling strategies for diseases management in
wildlife. We focused on different forms of the objective function, including
linear control, quadratic control, and control with limited amount of resources.
Moreover, we identified optimal solutions under different assumptions on
disease-free host dynamics, namely: self-regulating logistic growth, Malthusian
growth, and the case of negligible demography. We showed that the correct
characterization of the disease-free host growth is crucial for defining optimal
disease control strategies. By analytical investigations of the model with
negligible demography, we demonstrated that the optimal strategy for the linear
control can be either to cull at the maximum rate at the very beginning of the
epidemic (reactive culling) when the culling cost is low, or never to cull, when
culling cost is high. On the other hand, in the cases of quadratic control or
limited resources, we demonstrated that the optimal strategy is always reactive.
Numerical analyses for hosts with logistic growth showed that, in the case of
linear control, the optimal strategy is always reactive when culling cost is
low. In contrast, if the culling cost is high, the optimal strategy is to delay
control, i.e. not to cull at the onset of the epidemic. Finally, we showed that
for diseases with the same basic reproduction number delayed control can be
optimal for acute infections, i.e. characterized by high disease-induced
mortality and fast dynamics, while reactive control can be optimal for chronic
ones.},

  Abstract                 = {This work concerns the application of the optimal
control theory to Dengue epidemics. The dynamics of this insect-borne disease is
modelled as a set of non-linear ordinary differential equations including the
effect of educational campaigns organized to motivate the population to break
the reproduction cycle of the mosquitoes by avoiding the accumulation of still
water in open-air recipients. The cost functional is such that it reflects a
compromise between actual financial spending (in insecticides and educational
campaigns) and the population health (which can be objectively measured in terms
of, for instance, treatment costs and loss of productivity). The optimal control
problem is solved numerically using a multiple shooting method. However, the
optimal control policy is difficult to implement by the health authorities
because it is not practical to adjust the investment rate continuously in time.
Therefore, a suboptimal control policy is computed assuming, as the admissible
set, only those controls which are piecewise constant. The performance achieved
by the optimal control and the sub-optimal control policies are compared with
the cases of control using only insecticides when Breteau Index is greater or
equal to 5 and the case of no-control. The results show that the sub-optimal
policy yields a substantial reduction in the cost, in terms of the proposed
functional, and is only slightly inferior to the optimal control policy.

  Abstract                 = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a new,
highly contagious, viral disease, emerged in China late in 2002 and quickly
spread to 32 countries and regions causing in excess of 774 deaths and 8098
infections worldwide. In the absence of a rapid diagnostic test, therapy or
vaccine, isolation of individuals diagnosed with SARS and quarantine of
individuals feared exposed to SARS virus were used to control the spread of
infection. We examine mathematically the impact of isolation and quarantine on
the control of SARS during the outbreaks in Toronto, Hong Kong, Singapore and
Beijing using a deterministic model that closely mimics the data for cumulative
infected cases and SARS{\textendash}related deaths in the first three regions
but not in Beijing until mid{\textendash}April, when China started to report
data more accurately. The results reveal that achieving a reduction in the
contact rate between susceptible and diseased individuals by isolating the
latter is a critically important strategy that can control SARS outbreaks with
or without quarantine. An optimal isolation programme entails timely
implementation under stringent hygienic precautions defined by a critical
threshold value. Values below this threshold lead to control, but those above
are associated with the incidence of new community outbreaks or nosocomial
infections, a known cause for the spread of SARS in each region. Allocation of
resources to implement optimal isolation is more effective than to implement
sub{\textendash}optimal isolation and quarantine together. A
community{\textendash}wide eradication of SARS is feasible if optimal isolation
is combined with a highly effective screening programme at the points of
entry.},

  Abstract                 = {Information spreading in a population can be
modeled as an epidemic. Campaigners (e.g., election campaign managers, companies
marketing products or movies) are interested in spreading a message by a given
deadline, using limited resources. In this paper, we formulate the above
situation as an optimal control problem and the solution (using Pontryagin's
Maximum Principle) prescribes an optimal resource allocation over the time of
the campaign. We consider two different scenarios—in the first, the campaigner
can adjust a direct control (over time) which allows her to recruit individuals
from the population (at some cost) to act as spreaders for the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model. In the second case, we
allow the campaigner to adjust the effective spreading rate by incentivizing the
infected in the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, in addition to the
direct recruitment. We consider time varying information spreading rate in our
formulation to model the changing interest level of individuals in the campaign,
as the deadline is reached. In both the cases, we show the existence of a
solution and its uniqueness for sufficiently small campaign deadlines. For the
fixed spreading rate, we show the effectiveness of the optimal control strategy
against the constant control strategy, a heuristic control strategy and no
control. We show the sensitivity of the optimal control to the spreading rate
profile when it is time varying.},

  Abstract                 = {This work focuses on optimal vaccination policies
for an Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) model; the impact of the disease is
minimized with respect to the vaccination strategy. The problem is formulated as
an optimal control problem and we show that the value function is the unique
viscosity solution of an Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation. This allows to
find the best vaccination policy. At odds with existing literature, it is seen
that the value function is not always smooth (sometimes only Lipschitz) and the
optimal vaccination policies are not unique. Moreover we rigorously analyze the
situation when vaccination can be modeled as instantaneous (with respect to the
time evolution of the epidemic) and identify the global optimum solutions.
Numerical applications illustrate the theoretical results. In addition the
pertussis vaccination in adults is considered from two perspectives: first the
maximization of DALY averted in presence of vaccine side-effects; then the
impact of the herd immunity on the cost-effectiveness analysis is discussed on a
concrete example.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an application of optimal control
theory to Dengue epidemics. This epidemiologic disease is important in tropical
countries due to the growing number of infected individuals. The dynamic model
is described by a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, that depend
on the dynamics of the Dengue mosquito, the number of infected individuals, and
people's motivation to combat the mosquito. The cost functional depends not only
on the costs of medical treatment of the infected people but also on the costs
related to educational and sanitation campaigns. Two approaches for solving the
problem are considered: one using optimal control theory, the other carried out
by first discretizing the problem and then solving it with nonlinear
programming. The results obtained with OC-ODE and IPOPT solvers are given and
discussed. We observe that with current computational tools it is easy to
obtain, in an efficient way, better solutions to Dengue problems, leading to a
decrease in the number of infected mosquitoes and individuals in less time and
with lower costs. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Mathematical models provide a powerful tool for
investigating the dynamics and control of infectious diseases, but quantifying
the underlying epidemic structure can be challenging especially for new and
under-studied diseases. Variations of standard SIR, SIRS, and SEIR
epidemiological models are considered to determine the sensitivity of these
models to various parameter values that may not be fully known when the models
are used to investigate emerging diseases. Optimal control theory is applied to
suggest the most effective mitigation strategy to minimize the number of
individuals who become infected in the course of an infection while efficiently
balancing vaccination and treatment applied to the models with various cost
scenarios. The optimal control simulations suggest that regardless of the
particular epidemiological structure and of the comparative cost of mitigation
strategies, vaccination, if available, would be a crucial piece of any
intervention plan.},

provide a comprehensive description of the algorithm, including the feasibility

correction of the KKT matrix. Heuristics are also considered that allow faster
performance. This method has been implemented in the IPOPT code, which we
demonstrate in a detailed numerical study based on 954 problems from the CUTEr
test set. An evaluation is made of several line-search options, and a comparison
is provided with two state-of-the-art interior-point codes for nonlinear

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we propose a
susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) epidemic model which describes the
interaction between susceptible and infected individuals in a community and
analyze the SIR epidemic model through the optimal control theory and
mathematical analysis. In addition, we present some possible strategies to
prevent the spread of some infection causing epidemic in the society. In order
to do this, we introduce an optimal control problem with an objective
functional, where two control functions, vaccination and treatment have been
used as control measures for susceptible and infected individuals. We show the
existence of an optimal control pair for the optimal control problem and derive
the optimality condition. Finally we consider a smoking epidemic model to
illustrate our theoretical results with some numerical simulations, which use
real data collected in April and May 2004 from 300 male students at three
vocational technical high schools in Korean metropolitan areas. Our analysis
suggests that two control strategies are more effective than only one control
strategy in controlling the increase of male student smokers in Korean
metropolitan areas.},
